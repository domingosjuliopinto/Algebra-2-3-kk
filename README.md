# Algebra-2-3-kk
This is a live website that will randomly generate mathematical questions, one from each category. Since this was developed for a client, there are three categories in this website.They are 'Multiply 2 3-digit numbers' , 'Find Squareroot of a number generated whose answer is from 1 to 100' and 'Find Cuberoot of a number generated whose answer is from 1 to 100'. CSS was used for the flip card feature,while javascript was used for randomly generating the questions. This website is hosted using Github Pages<br>
